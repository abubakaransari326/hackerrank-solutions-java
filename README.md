# hackerrank-solutions-java
Solutions for hackerrank problems in Java 8.
This is an IntelliJ project with solutions to hackerrank problems. Each problem has a class to it's name in the folder with it's difficulty. You just need to create the object of that class in Main class and then call the 
intended function with the required parameters. You can copy the parameters from the problem description or test cases on hackerrank.
P.S: I am solving the problems myself so the respository might not have all the solutions. New solutions will only be added if I am able to solve them xD
